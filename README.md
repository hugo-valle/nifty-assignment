# Nifty Assignment

## Water Usage Billing System
- Audience: CS1 course. Introduction to Programming

### Overview

In this assignment, you will create a Python program to calculate a water bill based on the number of gallons used in a household. The water bill will be determined using a tiered pricing structure, where different prices per gallon apply to different usage levels. The goal is to develop a program that calculates the total water bill for a household based on their water consumption.

## Task 1: Basic Water Billing

Python Module: `Python Variables`

Create a Python script that takes user input for the number of gallons of water used in a household.
Calculate and display the total water bill for the household based on the given input.


## Task 2: Basic Water Billing with minimum charge

Python Module: `Basic Conditionals (branching)`

Extend your program to include a basic pricing structure for water usage.
- Define a basic billing structure with a flat rate for the first 2,000 gallons and an additional rate for any gallons used beyond 2,000.
- Calculate and display the total water bill for the household based on the given input.


## Task 3: Tier Water Billing

Python Module: `Intermediate Conditionals (Branching)`

Extend your program to include a tiered pricing structure for water usage.
Define multiple tiers, each with its own price per gallon. For example, consider three tiers: 0-2,000 gallons, 2,001-5,000 gallons, and over 5,000 gallons.
- Calculate the water bill by applying the appropriate rate for each tier based on the user's input.
- Display the total water bill, along with a breakdown of charges for each tier.


## Task 4: Total Year Bill

Python Module: `Loops`

Extend your program to include a tiered pricing structure for water usage, for a year of usage. The twelve-month usage will come from a list of 12 integers.
- Define multiple tiers, each with its own price per gallon. For example, consider three tiers: 0-2,000 gallons, 2,001-5,000 gallons, and over 5,000 gallons.
- Loop over the list and calculate the water bill by applying the appropriate rate for each tier based on each item of the list.
- Display the total water bill for the year, along with a breakdown of charges for each tier.


## Task 5: Intermediate Tiered Billing

Python Module: `Functions, Refactoring and Error Handling`

Refactor your code from Task 4 by allowing customization of the tiered pricing structure. Make sure you include functions
- Modify your program to allow the user to define the pricing tiers and their respective rates through user input.
- Implement error handling to ensure that tiers are defined correctly (e.g., in ascending order) and that rates are valid positive numbers.
- Calculate the water bill using the user-defined tiered pricing structure.
- Display the total water bill and the breakdown of charges for each user-defined tier.


## Task 6: Advanced Tiered Billing Challenge (optional)

Python Module: `Files`

- Add an optional challenge task that allows the user to specify different rates for peak and off-peak usage hours.
- Implement a time-of-day water usage input system where the user provides usage for both peak and off-peak hours.
- Calculate the water bill by applying the appropriate rates for each time period.
- Display the total water bill, showing charges for peak and off-peak hours separately.

The user should read all the data from a CSV file. 


## Task 7: Documentation and Testing (optional)

Python Module: `Testing`

- Write clear and concise documentation for your program, including explanations of how to use it and what each function does.
- Test your program with different input scenarios, including edge cases, and ensure it produces accurate results.



# Student Survey

After completing, you can survey students to gauge their awareness and consciousness about water conservation related to the assignment

1. Before working on the water usage billing assignment, how conscious were you about your personal water consumption habits?
   - [ ] Not conscious at all
   - [ ] Slightly conscious
   - [ ] Moderately conscious
   - [ ] Very conscious
   - [ ] Extremely conscious

2. After completing the water usage billing assignment, do you feel more aware of the importance of water conservation?
   - [ ] Yes, I am more aware now.
   - [ ] No, my awareness remains the same.
   - [ ] I'm not sure.

3. Did the assignment change any of your water usage habits at home? If so, please briefly describe how.

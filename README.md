## Water Usage Billing System
- Audience: CS1 course. Introduction to Programming

### Overview

In this assignment, you will create a Python program to calculate a water bill based on the number of gallons used in a household. The water bill will be determined using a tiered pricing structure, where different prices per gallon apply to different usage levels. The goal is to develop a program that calculates the total water bill for a household based on their water consumption.

## Task 1: Basic Water Billing

Python Module: `Python Variables`

Create a Python script that takes user input for the number of gallons of water used in a household.
Calculate and display the total water bill for the household based on the given input.


## Task 2: Basic Water Billing with minimum charge

Python Module: `Basic Conditionals (branching)`

Extend your program to include a basic pricing structure for water usage.
- Define a basic billing structure with a flat rate for the first 2,000 gallons and an additional rate for any gallons used beyond 2,000.
- Calculate and display the total water bill for the household based on the given input.

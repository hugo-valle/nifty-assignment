    <h1>Nifty Assignment</h1>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> In this assignment, students will create a Python program to 
        calculate a water bill based on the number of gallons used in a household. 
        The water bill will be determined using a tiered pricing structure, 
        where different prices per gallon apply to different usage levels. 
        The goal is to develop a program that calculates the total water bill for 
        a household based on their water consumption.</p>
    <p><b>Topics:</b> This assignment threads consideration of sustainable water usage
        with basic programming concepts including variables, conditionals, branching, 
        loops, functions, code refactoring and error handling, file I/O and testing.
    </p>
    <p><b>Audience:</b> The audience for this assignment is students in a CS1 course.</p>
    <p><b>Length:</b> The assignment has 7 tasks, each with a specific focus. In addition,
        it includes survey questions focusing on consciousness surrounding water
        consumption and conservation. It is expected that students can complete each
        task in one hour of less.
    </p>
    <p><b>Strengths:</b> This assignment is modular, so instructors may have students complete
        all seven tasks, or only a portion of them. We hope instructors will use the 
        assignment to discuss sustainability concepts as well, although it works well
        without that component as well. It also helps students practice interacting with
        GitHub.
    </p>
    <p><b>Weaknessess:</b> The assignment is geared to courses that utilize Python only.</p>
    <p><b>Dependencies:</b> Basic familiarity with GitHub.</p>
    <p><b>Variants:</b> Instructors may select specific tasks to utilize and may opt in or
        out of the survey portion of the assignment.
    </p>
